# LearnLink
Our app is called LearnLink. This app is to match student with other students
to create study groups for their course. The app will allow the user to create a login page. If the user already has a login page then they can just sign in.
Users can message eachother, create a profile and match with other users for what requirements they want with their study group. Users can use the resources and have a personal grade calculator as well.
